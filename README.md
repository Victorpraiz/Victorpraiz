:triangular_flag_on_post: I recently began my career as a software engineer with Decagon. This entire journey began because I've always had a knack for technology. Prior to that, I was deeply engaged in content creation :camera_flash:, often posting informative and interactive videos on YouTube, Instagram, and Tiktok.

I'll always have a special spot for design as a professional Graphic Designer. I'm most productive :bulb: in the space between development and design.
